**This is a proof of concept in VERY, VERY, VERY alpha state.**

Overview
---

easy impress wants to be a very simple way to create
[impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js) slides with a simple
markdown file.

You can check the example for more information, since for the momment this
project is only proof of concept the documentation stinks :)

Installation
---

    python setup.py install

Usage
---

    easyimpress [markdown_input_file] > [html_output_file]

TODO
---

- Support some effect, this is the meaning of impress.js isn't? But how can
  I do it easy to use for the user?. Perhaps macros? Perhaps forcing some
  DOM elements to be rendered with special effects, like for example `<li/>`
  or `<code/>`.
- Add pygment for pieces of code.
- Add reStructured text support.
- Add some theming.
